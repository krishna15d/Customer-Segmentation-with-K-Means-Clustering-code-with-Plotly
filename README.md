# K-Means Clustering with Plotly

Enhanced and interactive data visualization and clustering using K-Means algorithm with Plotly. This repository includes Python code for loading customer data, determining optimal cluster count with an elbow plot, and visualizing clusters using an interactive scatterplot. It's a valuable tool for customer segmentation and data analysis.

## Features:
- Interactive elbow plot for choosing the optimal number of clusters.
- Color-coded cluster visualization using Plotly.
- Code improvements over the standard Matplotlib and Seaborn approach.
- Suitable for various data analysis and presentation needs.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Add your data or modify the existing dataset.
3. Run the Python code for K-Means clustering.
4. Visualize the results with interactive Plotly plots.

Feel free to customize and use this code for your data clustering and visualization needs. If you find it helpful, consider giving it a star and sharing it with others!
